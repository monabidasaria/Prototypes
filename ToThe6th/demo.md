# To The 6th Demo

A trust-based social networking prototype that helps people meet new friends through mutual introductions.

Built in Figma Make with a Supabase backend, To The 6th lets users classify first-degree connections as Acquaintance or Able to Introduce, unlock second-degree circles when trust is mutual, and request introductions that lead to real-world meetups. The MVP includes conversational onboarding, intelligent event suggestions, and an incentive system that rewards genuine connections.
